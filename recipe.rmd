## Subaru Data Recipes

This assignment asks you to do a few discrete tasks using `recipes` to 
manipulate data in R. We'll work with two data sets: 

* `subaru_data.txt`: We discussed this data in class this week. This data set has
27K rows of Craigslist car listings. The response variable we'll ultimately care
about is `price`. There are a mix of helpful and unhelpful columns available 
to us. 

Additionally, I have a task for you to perform that requires you to work 
with some time series information in R using `lubridate`. 

```{r message=F}
d.subaru <- read_tsv("subaru_data.txt") %>% 
  mutate(odometer = as.numeric(odometer),
         year = as.numeric(year))

d.dates <- tibble(dt = seq(ymd("2018-01-01"),
                             ymd("2020-12-31"),
                             by="days")) %>% 
  mutate(yr = year(dt),
         mon = month(dt,label=T),
         day = day(dt),
         week_day = wday(dt,label=T))


```

This section asks you to build a recipe for the Subaru data to process 
some of those columns. You'll `prep` the recipe on `d.subaru`, then
`juice` it to get the transformed tibble out. Then I've asked you to answer 
some questions about the results. 

### Auto Models

The auto models in this data set are messy. There are 
`r length(unique(d.subaru$model))` different makes and 
`r scales::percent(mean(is.na(d.subaru$model)))` of the values 
are missing. Here's a messy picture: 

```{r}
 d.subaru %>% 
  count(model) %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_reorder(factor(model),.x=n,.fun=sum)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=n,y=model)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x="Number of Rows (Log)",y="Raw Subaru Model") + 
  scale_x_log10(label=scales::comma_format())

```

The top five, (Outback, Forester, Legacy, Impreza, WRX) have enough data to
support modeling. We'd like to map others to an "Other" category. When you build
your recipe, include a step that transforms the `model` column to do this mapping.

### Odometer Data

The odometer data is hand-entered, which makes it messy. We could realistically
expect a log-relationship with mileage, since going from 10K to 20K miles is 
different than going from 200K to 210K. Add a step to your recipe to do 
a log-transform of this column. 

### Missing Data in Year

The `year` column clearly has some incorrect data in it. Additionally, 
the `year` column is completed for `r scales::percent(mean(!is.na(d.subaru$year)))`
of our rows. Using either the K-nearest neighbors or linear model imputation 
methods, add a recipe step that imputes `year`. Pay attention to what covariates
you're using to do the imputation and be prepared to justify your choices. 

## Your Recipe

Use the code block below to add steps to your recipe. 

```{r}
d.prep <- d.subaru %>% 
  recipe() %>% 
  # No steps yet, but yours go here. 
  prep() %>% 
  juice()



```

## Additional Tasks

With your `recipe` written, now some tasks for you: 

1. Re-do the above plot of models on your prepped data. Interpret the results. 
1. Build a plot of odometer reading in the original data versus the transformed
data. Which observations look odd? Were any new infinite values created when you 
took the `log`? How come? What is a quick change to the recipe step that would 
eliminate these? 
1. Make a scatterplot of counts by year in the original data versus in the 
imputed data. Which years show the biggest changes?

## Build Holiday Ranges

The list found at `timeDate::listHolidays()` may be useful for this exercise. 
Using a mix of `recipes` and `dplyr`, add the following columns to our `d.dates`
data set: 

* Add dummy variables for the major holidays in the US: Presidents' Day, 
  MLK's Birthday, Christmas Day, Election Day, New Year's Day, Thanksgiving, 
  Veteran's Day, Independence Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Christmas Eve, and
  New Year's Eve. 
* Add a column called `dt_spring` that has a 1 for every day between 
  Easter Sunday and Labor Day. Note that this isn't a canned `step_` function.
  (I had to do that for a model once because this was a busy time for shopping
  for spring clothing lines.)
* Have all your columns begin with the string "dt_" so that we can see them on the 
  plot
  
To get you've started and to test the plotting, I've added one holiday for you. 

```{r}
prepped.date.data <- d.dates %>% 
  recipe() %>% 
  step_holiday(dt,holidays = c("USIndependenceDay")) %>% 
  prep() %>% 
  juice()


prepped.date.data %>% 
  select(starts_with("dt")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=-dt,
               names_to="holiday") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=dt,y=value,color=holiday)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~holiday) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x="Date",y="Holiday Indicator",color="Column")


```

I haven't written this yet! It's on my to-do list, though. In the meantime,
ask questions about the data on Teams!
